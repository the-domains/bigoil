  From the section Science & Environment The crack that looks set to spawn a
  giant iceberg in the Antarctic has continued to spread. The rift in the Larsen
  C Ice Shelf has grown a further 10km since 1 January. If the rift propagates
  just 20km more, it will free a tabular berg one-quarter the size of Wales.
